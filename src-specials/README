For javascript optimization you need to download the latest "Closure"
http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/

Unzip the jar file and put it somewhere safe, then set an environment variable
that points to it:

export ZML_CLOSURE_JAR=/home/me/sbin/compiler.jar # or whatever

It requires Java 6 to run (bleh.  I know I know, but I don't have time to port
it).
