POLISH

- Say you have a big paragraph of text over multiple lines, and you have lots
  of :strong ...; stuff like that embedded all over, and your text editor puts
  one of those :strong ...; things at the beginning of the line- will the
  compiler choke on the ';'?  It needs to not choke, and needs to, in that
  case, not allow indented children either.

FUTURE

- Analyze class attributes and decide to change them to ID's- change CSS
  accordingly
- Automatically figure out which CSS rules are irrelevant and exclude them
  (flag to disallow this somehow)
- Apply other CSS optimization techniques- safe equivalents that are rendered faster or more broadly.
