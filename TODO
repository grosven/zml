- Clean up cruft from changing from automatic stdout emissions
- Make sure that paths to external script file are relative to the dump directory
- Have emit produce an array of strings that can easily be combined or output in chunks
- Break into ngx-rome chunks (based on command line options)


FUTURE

- Analyze class attributes and decide to change them to ID's- change CSS
  accordingly
- Automatically figure out which CSS rules are irrelevant and exclude them
  (flag to disallow this somehow)


SPECIALIZED

- Special tag modules
- Server-side directives / code - compiled in - main template compiler
- gen_server / batcher / whatever
