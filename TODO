SPECIALIZED

- Special tag modules
- Templates compiled for very fast erlang execution
- gen_server / batcher / zwapp-minimal


FUTURE

- Analyze class attributes and decide to change them to ID's- change CSS
  accordingly
- Automatically figure out which CSS rules are irrelevant and exclude them
  (flag to disallow this somehow)
- Apply other CSS optimization techniques- safe equivalents that are rendered faster or more broadly.
