h2. Summary

Inspired by SLiP, haml, and sexp2xml. Concise markup language for general xml
or as a python templating language using pytenjin.

h3. Example 1

<pre><code>
# Ok, here's my html

:html
    :head(title='hey there')
    :body
        :table(class="mytable redish another", blah='random')
            :tr  # First row, for fun.
                :td Here is some text 
                :td 'and some more with craziness ;(*)(&lt;<>&lt;>'
</code></pre>

h4. Main points:

* Uses indentation to designate tag nesting. Takes care of closing tags etc. all by itself, which reduces redundancy and visual clutter.
* Attributes in parentheses, if you like. They actually don’t need commas between them, and can span extra lines as in:

<pre><code>
:html(
    onload="openstuff()" 
    id="thehtml" 
    class = 'one two three')

    :head  #....
</code></pre>

* Comments with #
* Enclose any special characters in quotes. Normal quoting rules apply, escape with backslash.
* This works great for the majority of html, but sometimes you need embedded
html, like “blah &lt;emph&gt;blah&lt;/emph&gt; blah blah!” – in that case, just do it as a string like I just wrote.

h4. Features still to describe:

* Embedded python and variables
* Including other files
* Specialized tags
* Caching
* How it works super, super, super fast…
* Integrating with ngx-rome

For now look in sample.zml
